# PWA Icons and Screenshots Setup

## Required Icons

Create the following icon files in the `public/icons/` directory. Each icon should represent the Allo Huissiers brand and be optimized for PWA usage:

### Icon Sizes Required:
- `icon-72x72.png` - 72x72 pixels
- `icon-96x96.png` - 96x96 pixels
- `icon-128x128.png` - 128x128 pixels
- `icon-144x144.png` - 144x144 pixels
- `icon-152x152.png` - 152x152 pixels
- `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels (minimum for PWA)
- `icon-384x384.png` - 384x384 pixels
- `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels (recommended for PWA)

### Design Guidelines:
- Use the Allo Huissiers brand colors (primary: #1e40af)
- Include scales of justice or gavel symbolism for judicial services
- Ensure high contrast and legibility at small sizes
- Use Arabic/French text elements if space allows
- Make icons "maskable" compatible with safe zone considerations

## Required Screenshots

Create the following screenshot files in the `public/screenshots/` directory for PWA store listings:

### Screenshot Requirements:
- `mobile-screenshot-1.png` - 375x812 pixels (narrow form factor)
  - Show the home screen with judicial officer search interface
  - Include Arabic interface elements

- `desktop-screenshot-1.png` - 1280x720 pixels (wide form factor)
  - Show dashboard for managing judicial service requests
  - Include both user and huissier perspectives

### Design Guidelines:
- Use actual app screenshots when available
- Show key features like search, booking, emergency requests
- Include realistic Arabic text and location data for Morocco
- Ensure screenshots represent the actual user experience

## Icon Generation Tools:
- Use tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Illustrator
- Consider using PWA icon generators like pwa-asset-generator
- Ensure all icons are PNG format with transparent backgrounds where appropriate

## Next Steps:
1. Create or commission professional icon designs
2. Generate all required sizes
3. Take actual app screenshots once features are implemented
4. Test PWA installation with proper icons
